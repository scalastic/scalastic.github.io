AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.

It is created by default when resgistering on AWS. It shouldn't be used except for creating AWS account setup. We can even imagine that it is used to create the first AWS account with administrator rights and that's it.

## AWS User (or IAM User)

An **AWS user** is one physical person and only one :
  - AWS user accounts must be protected by a strong **Password Policy** and **Multi Factor Authentication** (MFA) to access AWS Management Console.
  - For programmatic access via CLI (AWS Command Line Interface) from a console or SDK (AWS Softawre Development Kit) from an application, users can use **Access Keys** (an Access Key ID + an Access Key Secret) to access AWS Services.
  - Users permissions are managed throught **IAM Policies** either on users directly or even better on **Groups** to which users belong.

### How to use Access Key?

Let's take the connection example to an EC2 instance.


1. Set the file permissions
To secure the PEM file containing your Access Key ID and its Secret Key, AWS verify that your PEM file permissions are secure. That means you always should set this permissions before using it:

{% highlight Bash %}
chmod 0400 <ACCESS-KEY-FILE>.pem
{% endhighlight %}

2. Connect to your instance
On Linux instances, user name is `ec2-user`. Let's ssh into it:

{% highlight Bash %}
ssh -i <ACCESS-KEY-FILE>.pem ec2-user@<PUBLIC-IP-SERVER>
{% endhighlight %}

## IAM Role

**IAM Role** gives permissions to an AWS Service to access AWS informations.
