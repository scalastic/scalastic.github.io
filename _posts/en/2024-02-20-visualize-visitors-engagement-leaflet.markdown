## Introduction to Interactive Dataviz

Our data visualization tool is designed to offer an immersive experience in analyzing user engagement data from our 
website specialized in DevOps. Thanks to the use of the JavaScript library 
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}, we have created an interactive 
map that illustrates the geographical distribution of visitors, as well as the intensity of their interaction with the 
site's content.

The map uses color markers and layers to represent different levels of activity, allowing users to quickly identify the 
hotspots of web traffic. This real-time interaction allows the user to discover activity patterns that might otherwise 
remain hidden in simple data tables.

Moreover, our dataviz offers the possibility to filter data by operating system and search engine. This level of 
customization reveals technological preferences by region and can help understand how cultural, economic, and political 
factors influence web usage and the choice of digital tools.

The zoom functionality allows examining specific areas in more detail, providing a microscopic view of specific regions 
and their engagement with the site. This tool is not only a means of displaying data but also a platform for exploration
that invites analysis and discovery.

Visualizing activity by hour of the day is another fascinating aspect of our tool. A circular graph illustrates the 
site's activity over a full day, revealing a wave of engagement that spreads from east to west, following the sunrise 
across the meridians. This phenomenon highlights the global nature of the DevOps community and its work patterns 
synchronized with circadian cycles.

Therefore, this dataviz is not just a means of presenting data; it acts as a visual narrative that transforms numbers 
into stories, allowing users to understand the complex nuances of online activity among IT professionals.
