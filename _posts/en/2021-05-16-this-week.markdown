This week, Artificial Intelligence to land SpaceX's Starship rocket, reactive programming with a tutorial on Spring WebFlux and an open source project in the spotlight, ruby-vips, widely used on this site to convert images in lossless formats.

Happy reading everyone.

## 1. SpaceX Starship landing

The Starship landing algorithm, based on a Reinforcement Learning method:
