Here we will see the different storage services that can be used by an EC2 instance as well as their characteristics and their use cases.

## EBS Volume

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is a web service that provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be used as hard drive.

- It's a Network drive:
  * It uses the network to communicate with the instance
  * There might be a bit of latency
  * Can be dettached and attached quickly while the instance is running
  * Can only be mounted to one instance at a time (except for multi-attached - see bellow)

- It's locked to a specific Availibility Zone:
  * You could not bound to an instance whitin another A.Z.
  * But you can snapshot it and copy it to another A.Z.

- It can be deleted or not after instance termination:
  * So data can be persistent or not

### Types of EBS

#### gp2 or gp3 (SSD):

  * General purpose SSD volume with a balanced price and performance
  * 1 Gib to 16 TiB
  * **gp2**: 
    - IOPS is linked with the volume size 
    - Max IOPS is 16,000 at 5,333 GiB
    - Small volume size can burst to 3,000
  * **gp3**:
    - IOPS starts at 3,000
    - IOPS and throughput can increase independently up to 16,000 and 1000 MiB/s
  * **Use cases**: Boot volume, non-Prod environment


#### io1 or io2 (SSD) or Provisioned IOPS SSD (PIOPS)

  * The Highest performance SSD for low-latency and high-throughput workloads
  * Supports EBS Multi-attach
  * **io1 / io2**: 
    - 4 GiB to 16 TiB
    - Max IOPS 64,000 with Nitro EC2 otherwise 32,000 with others instance type
    - PIOPS can increase independently of storage size
  * **io2 Block Express**:
    - 4 GiB to 64 TiB
    - Sub-millisecond latency
    - Max PIOS 256,000 with IOPS:GiB ratio of 1000:1 (that means max PIOPS is reached from 256 GiB)
  * **Use cases**: Databases

#### st1 (HDD) or Throughput Optimized:

  * Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed and throughput intensive workloads
  * Can NOT be a Boot volume
  * 125 MiB to 16 TiB
  * Max IOPS is 500 and throughput 500 MiB/s
  * **Use cases**: Big Data, Data Warehouse, Log Processing

#### sc1 (HDD) or Cold HDD:

  * The Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
  * Can NOT be a Boot volume
  * 125 MiB to 16 TiB
  * Max IOPS is 250 and throughput 250 MiB/s
  * **Use cases**: Data that is infrequently accessed where lower cost is important

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="EBS Multi-attach">

### EBS Multi-attach

* Only for io1 and io2 family
* You can attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances within the same A.Z.
* Each instance has full read / write permissions to the volume
* But must use a clustered file system to preserve data consistency 

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="EFS">

## EFS

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides file storage for your Amazon EC2 instances. It's a managed NFS (Network File System) that can be mounted to multiple EC2 instances:

* It's increasing automatically, so you don't have to provision anything and you pay-per-use
* Is multi-AZ
* You have to use Security Group to access to EFS
* Uses NFSv4.1 protocol and is only compatible with POSIX Operating System (including Linux, macOS but not Windows)
* Use cases: Content management, web server, data sharing.

### Modes and classes

* Scaling:
  - 100s of concurrent NFS clients with 10+ GiB/s throughput
  - Can grow to Petabyte

* Performance mode:
  - General Purpose: latency sensitive apps like web server, CMS, ...
  - Max I/O: higher latency, throughput but highly parallel : Big Data, Media Processing, ...

* Throughput mode:
  - Bursting: depends on the storage size (e.g. 1 TB = 50 MiB/s with burst up to 100 MiB/s)
  - Provisioned: you set your desired throughput (e.g; 1 TB with 1 GiB/s)

* Storage Tiers:
  - Standard: for frequently accessed files
  - Infrequent Access: move file after n-days to EFS-IA which costs less but cost to retrieve the files


<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Instance Store">

## Instance Store

- Hight performance harware disk with high I/O
- But ephemeral:
  * Data is lost when the instance is stopped
  * You have to manage backup and restoration yourself if you don't want it to be deleted
- Good for cache, buffer and temporary data
