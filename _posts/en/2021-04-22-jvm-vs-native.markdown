To compare the execution of a Java application between its Bytecode (JVM) and native (GraalVM) versions, you must first decide on its architecture and the framewoks to use. Secondly, we must also ask ourselves what we are going to measure.

Recently, I came across a very interesting course, [containers and orchestration](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}, by Jérôme Petazzoni . It uses different Python and Ruby applications which interact by means of Docker containers. They act as a mesh of microservices. The efficiency of the system is measured by the number of treatments performed per second.

It seemed like a good example to serve as a basis for this comparison by:
- Transposing the code into Java language under the Spring Boot / WebFlux frameworks and using Spring Native for the build in Bytecode or in native,
- Playing on the number of containers in order to vary the load of the system.

Let's see this in detail.

### Requirements

To implement this solution, we will need:
1. A **Kubernetes** cluster to run our containers,
1. Different **processing measurements** from microservices
1. **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to collect and display these measurements,
1. A Java application compilable in **Bytecode** and **native**

Well, that's not much and it already exists:

* In a previous article, I explain how to install a complete Kubernetes, Prometheus and Grafana stack - [Locally install Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana]({{site.baseurl}}/install-kubernetes-prometheus-grafana/),
* By integrating **Micrometer** with a Java **Spring Boot** application, it is possible to expose the measurements of its services - [HasherHandler.java](https://github.com/scalastic/hotspot-vs-native/blob/main/hasher-java/src/main/java/io/scalastic/jvmvsnative/hasher/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"},
* For a Python application, the **prometheus_client** library also allows to expose measurements - [worker.py](https://github.com/scalastic/hotspot-vs-native/blob/main/worker/worker.py){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"},
* By configuring the Maven POM with the `org.springframework.experimental:spring-native` dependency, it is possible to compile the application in Bytecode as well as in native.


> info "Spring version"
>
> These are the latest versions of **Spring Experimental** that will be used to develop our Java microservices. Indeed, they continuously correct and improve the bugs and the performance of the native build. But keep in mind that these are beta versions:
> - Spring `2.5.0-RC1`
> - Spring Native `0.10.0-SNAPSHOT`
>

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Application Architecture">

## Application Architecture

Let's see what the application is made of:

![Application Architecture]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/application-architecture.jpg)

The application is made up of 4 microservices:
1. `worker`: the algorithm orchestrator [***Python***] which gets `1` a random number, `2` hash it and `3` increment a counter in the redis database,
2. `rng`: the random number generator [***Java***],
3. `hasher`: the hash processor [***Java***],
4. `redis`: the database which records a processing cycle counter.

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Build">

## Build the app

The purpose of the compilation is to produce one Docker image by microservice. For Java microservices, there will be two images, the first in **Bytecode**, the second in **native**.

> note "Optional"
>
> I have put these images in a public registry on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/scalastic){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}, so you can skip this build step.

### Requirements for the build

However, if you want to create these Docker images, you will need to install:
- [GraalVM 21.1.0 Java 11 based](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#install-graalvm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}
- [GraalVM Native Images](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#native-images){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}

### The easy way

> warning "Note"
> - It should work on **Linux** and **macOS** based systems - *and on **Windows** with some small modifications
> - It will take time....... 10-20 min depending on your internet connection and processor! That's the price to compile to native code.

To do so, execute this script in the project root:
{% highlight Bash %}
./build_docker_images.sh
{% endhighlight %}


### Summary of executed commands

- For a **non-java** app:

{% highlight Bash %}
docker build -t <app_docker_tag> ./<app_dir>
{% endhighlight %}

- For **JVM-based** image:

{% highlight Bash %}
cd <app_dir>
mvn clean package
docker build -t <app_docker_tag> .
{% endhighlight %}

- For a **Java native** image:

{% highlight Bash %}
cd <app_dir>
mvn spring-boot:build-image
{% endhighlight %}

### From Docker Hub

You can pull pre-build images from Docker Hub by entering:

{% highlight Bash %}
docker pull jeanjerome/rng-jvm:1.0.0
docker pull jeanjerome/hasher-jvm:1.0.0
docker pull jeanjerome/worker-python:1.0.0
docker pull jeanjerome/rng-native:1.0.0
docker pull jeanjerome/hasher-native:1.0.0
{% endhighlight %}

### Check

To list your local docker images, enter:

{% highlight Bash %}
docker images
{% endhighlight %}

At least, you should see these images in your local registry:
{% highlight Bash %}
REPOSITORY                TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
rng-jvm                   1.0.0      f4bfdacdd2a1   4 minutes ago       242MB
hasher-jvm                1.0.0      ab3600420eab   11 minutes ago      242MB
worker-python             1.0.0      e2e76d5f8ad4   38 hours ago        55MB
hasher-native             1.0.0      629bf3cb8760   41 years ago        82.2MB
rng-native                1.0.0      68e484d391f3   41 years ago        82.2MB

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Kubernetes">

## Kubernetes configuration

First, we need to define the kubernetes configuration of our application and tell Prometheus where to find the metrics.

### Kubernetes Stack Architecture

Let's see how to install these microservices in our kubernetes cluster:
- The architecture of the application is deployed in a dedicated namespace, `demo`,
- The monitoring tools are in another namespace called `monitoring`.

![Kubernetes Architecture]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/kubernetes-architecture.jpg)

1. We want to manage the number of ~~containers~~ - pods in this case - for each microservice,
1. We also want to be able to change the pod image (Bytecode or native) without needing to redeploy everything.

    => Such Kubernetes resource already exists, [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}


1. We need our microservices to communicate with each other in the Kubernetes cluster.

     => This is the job of the resource [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}.


1. The Redis database does not need to be accessible from outside, only from inside the cluster.

     => This is already the case because, by default, Kubernetes Services are of type [ClusterIP](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}.


1. We want application metrics to be collected by Prometheus.

     => Here is [how to configure it](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/containers/tutorials/monitoring-kubernetes-prometheus/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}

Take a look at the Hasher microservice configuration below:

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Grafana">

## Grafana configuration

To display the metrics collected by Prometheus, Grafana needs:
- A data source to Prometheus,
- A dashboard describing the metrics to display and in what form.

> info ""
> If you followed my previous article [Locally install Kubernetes, Prometheus et Grafana]({{site.baseurl}}/install-kubernetes-prometheus-grafana/), the data source is already configured and you can skip the next step. The Grafana interface is then accessible to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Data source configuration

Grafana uses YAML files to configure a data source. It can be defined using the Kubernetes ConfigMap resource:

{% highlight yaml %}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: monitoring
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: grafana-datasources
  namespace: monitoring
data:
  prometheus.yaml: |-
    {
        "apiVersion": 1,
        "datasources": [
            {
               "access":"proxy",
                "editable": true,
                "name": "prometheus",
                "orgId": 1,
                "type": "prometheus",
                "url": "http://prometheus-service.monitoring.svc:8080",
                "version": 1
            }
        ]
    }
{% endhighlight %}

It remains to pass this resource to Grafana in the definition of its Deployment:

{% highlight yaml %}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: grafana
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: grafana/grafana:latest
          name: grafana
.../...
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources
              name: grafana-datasources
              readOnly: false
      volumes:
        - name: grafana
          emptyDir: {}
        - name: grafana-datasources
          configMap:
            defaultMode: 420
            name: grafana-datasources
{% endhighlight %}


### Dashboard configuration


1. Connect to the Grafana web interface,
1. Import the pre-defined dashboard [demo-dashboard.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scalastic/hotspot-vs-native/main/_grafana/demo-dashboard.json),
1. Display the dashboard.

You should see an empty dashboard as follows:

![Empty Demo Grafana dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/grafana-demo-empty.png)


### Description of the Demo Dashboard

![Description of the Demo Grafana dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/grafana-demo-description.png)

* The rows of the table (labeled from A to C) represent the 3 microservices, respectively, Worker, Random Number Generator -RNG- and Hasher.

* The columns (numbered 1 to 4) represent different metrics:
   - In column 1, we can see the number of pods running as well as the speed of the processes
   - In column 2 is displayed the history of processing speeds, for each microservice,
   - In column 3 the CPU consumption of each pod is displayed,
   - In column 4, the RAM consumption of each pod.

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Starting">

## Starting the application

A Kubernetes configuration was created with Replicas of 1 pod for each microservice and Java images compiled in Bytecode.

- To start the application in Kubernetes, enter:

{% highlight Bash %}
kubectl apply -f _kube/k8s-app-jvm.yml
{% endhighlight %}


- You should see the output:

{% highlight Bash %}
namespace/demo created
deployment.apps/hasher created
service/hasher created
deployment.apps/rng created
service/rng created
deployment.apps/redis created
service/redis created
deployment.apps/worker created
service/worker created
{% endhighlight %}

- Visualize the start of the pods in Grafana:

  ![Grafana dashboard starting app]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/grafana-demo-starting-app.png)

> note "Result"
>
> - The observed processing speed, located in cell A1, gives us a basic measure of the efficiency for our application: `3.20` cycles / s.
> - Depending on the resources allocated to your space, you may get a different result.

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Playing">

## Play with Kubernetes configuration

### Overview

- Let's see the actual deployment's situation by entering:
{% highlight Bash %}
kubectl get deployment -n demo
{% endhighlight %}

- Which should return:
{% highlight Bash %}
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hasher   1/1     1            1           13m
redis    1/1     1            1           13m
rng      1/1     1            1           13m
worker   1/1     1            1           13m
{% endhighlight %}

### Increase pods' number

- To scale up `worker` pods to `2`, enter: 

{% highlight Bash %}
kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=2 -n demo
{% endhighlight %}

- Which returns:

{% highlight Bash %}
deployment.apps/worker scaled
{% endhighlight %}

### Impact on the application

- Let's take a look at the Grafana dashboard:

![Grafana dashboard 2 workers]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/grafana-demo-2-workers.png)

> note "Results"
> 
> You will notice that the speed of the application is multiplied by `x2`.


### Further increase the number of pods

- Let's go to 10 workers:

{% highlight Bash %}
kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=10 -n demo
{% endhighlight %}

![Grafana dashboard 10 workers]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/grafana-demo-10-workers.png)

> note "Results"
> 
> The speed of the process increases, but does not reach exactly 10x more: the latency of the 2 microservices, rng and hasher, which increased slightly, explains this.

-  Let's increase `hasher` and `rng` pods' number: 

{% highlight Bash %}
kubectl scale deployment hasher rng --replicas=5 -n demo
{% endhighlight %}

![Grafana dashboard 4 RNGs & Hashers]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/grafana-demo-4-rng-hasher.png)

> note "Results"
> 
> - The increase in the number of `hasher` and `rng` pods has reduced their latency, but it is still a little higher than at the beginning,
> - Another factor is limiting but we do not see which one in the displayed data.

### Let's deploy the native version of the application

- Replace the current image of the pods with their native version by updating their Deployment:
{% highlight Bash %}
kubectl set image deployment/hasher hasher=hasher-native:1.0.0 -n demo
kubectl set image deployment/rng rng=rng-native:1.0.0 -n demo
{% endhighlight %}

- Watch the rollout:
{% highlight Bash %}
kubectl rollout status deployment/hasher -n demo
{% endhighlight %}

- And open the Grafana dashboard:

![Grafana dashboard native RNGs & Hashers]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/grafana_demo_native_rng_hasher.png)

> note "Results"
>
> **Latency**
> - No change for the responsiveness of the microservices: undoubtedly, the code is too simple to benefit from a native build.
> 
> **CPU usage**
> - With Bytecode, CPU usage tended to decrease over time. This was due to the action of the HotSpot `C2` compiler which produces native code that is increasingly optimized over time.
> - In contrast, native processor usage is low from the start.
> 
> **RAM usage**
> - Surprisingly, native applications use more memory than Bytecode ones: it is all the more surprising that reducing the memory footprint is one of the advantages cited by the community.
> - Is it because of the Beta versions used in this demo or a memory leak in the implementation?

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Cleaning">

## Clean all

- To simply remove the app and all its microservices, enter:
{% highlight Bash %}
kubectl delete -f _kube/k8s-app-jvm.yml 
{% endhighlight %}

- which will remove all the Kubernetes configuration created previously:

{% highlight Bash %}
namespace "demo" deleted
deployment.apps "hasher" deleted
service "hasher" deleted
deployment.apps "rng" deleted
service "rng" deleted
deployment.apps "redis" deleted
service "redis" deleted
deployment.apps "worker" deleted
service "worker" deleted
{% endhighlight %}

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Conclusion">

## Conclusion

We learned how to install a full Kubernetes stack so that we can measure application metrics.

However, we are not getting the results we expect in the context of native applications. One explanation could be a lack of the Spring Beta version: Spring Native has just upgraded to version 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT and this is precisely the version where performance improvements are planned.

I'll open a ticket with the Spring Boot team to ask for their analysis.

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="What to do next?">

## What next?

### What is missing for a more realistic evaluation?

- Kubernetes configuration should always include a resource limit which has not been done in this demo.
- I could have used [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"}
  (HPA) and even better HPA on custom metrics (read [this post](https://itnext.io/horizontal-pod-autoscale-with-custom-metrics-8cb13e9d475){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"} 
  for more details).

> info "Question"
> - I wish I found something on self-regulating Scalers, able to maximize a metric but nothing about such a thing...
> - Have you ever heard of something like that?
