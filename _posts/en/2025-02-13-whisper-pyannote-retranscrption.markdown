## 1. Understanding Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

**Automatic Speech Recognition** (*ASR*) is a technology that converts human speech into text. It relies on models capable of analyzing an audio signal and extracting spoken words. ASR has applications in various fields, including accessibility for the hearing impaired, transcription of meetings or interviews, interaction with voice assistants, and indexing of audio and video content. Its effectiveness depends on several factors, such as sound quality, accent diversity, and background noise.

### Basic Functioning

ASR operates through several key steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: The audio signal is cleaned to reduce background noise and improve recording quality, then converted into a format usable by a model, often in the form of a spectrogram.
2. **Acoustic modeling**: Acoustic features such as frequency and amplitude are extracted from the audio signal to identify corresponding phonemes, the basic units of spoken language.
3. **Language modeling**: An algorithm predicts the most probable words and phrases based on the detected phonemes and contextual information.
4. **Decoding and correction**: The model adjusts the final transcription by accounting for potential errors and linguistic context.

Modern ASR systems utilize deep neural networks, which enhance accuracy and accommodate greater linguistic diversity.

### The Whisper Model

Developed by **OpenAI**, [Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"} is an advanced ASR model known for its robustness and versatility. It has been trained on a large volume of multilingual data, enabling it to perform effectively across various languages, accents, and contexts.  

#### Advantages and Features:  

- **High accuracy**: Whisper handles diverse accents and noisy environments well, improving transcription quality.  
- **Multilingual support**: It supports multiple languages and can automatically translate transcriptions.  
- **Subtitle generation**: It enables the creation of synchronized subtitles for audio and video content.  
- **Noise resistance**: Its robustness against background noise makes it highly effective for real-world audio transcription.  

Unlike traditional ASR models that require specific training on restricted datasets, Whisper is based on large-scale learning, allowing for better generalization. This makes it a powerful tool for any application requiring precise and high-quality transcription.

#### Implementing Whisper in Python

Integrating Whisper into a Python program is straightforward using the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"} library. A practical implementation involves using a speech recognition pipeline optimized for different hardware configurations.

Here’s an approach based on the **Whisper Large-v3 Turbo** model (a lightweight version of Whisper Large v3):

1. **Model loading**: The **WhisperAudioTranscriber** is initialized, automatically configuring the computing device (**GPU, MPS, or CPU**) based on hardware availability.  
2. **Model and processor preparation**: The Whisper model and its associated processor are loaded using `AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq` and `AutoProcessor`.  
3. **Pipeline configuration**: A pipeline is set up with specific parameters, such as segmenting the audio into 5-second chunks with a 1-second overlap and enabling timestamp return (`return_timestamps=True`).  
4. **Audio file transcription**: Calling the `transcribe(audio_path)` method executes the transcription and returns the text along with associated timestamps.  

Here is a code snippet demonstrating this approach:

{% highlight python %}
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor, pipeline

class WhisperAudioTranscriber():
    def __init__(self, model_name="openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo"):
        # Configure the device for computation
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            self.device = "cuda:0"
            self.torch_dtype = torch.float16
        elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
            self.device = "mps"
            self.torch_dtype = torch.float16
        else:
            self.device = "cpu"
            self.torch_dtype = torch.float32

        # Load the model and processor
        try:
            self.model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(
                model_name,
                torch_dtype=self.torch_dtype,
                low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
                use_safetensors=True,
            )
            self.model.to(self.device)

            self.processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name)

            # Configure the pipeline for automatic speech recognition
            self.pipe = pipeline(
                "automatic-speech-recognition",
                model=self.model,
                tokenizer=self.processor.tokenizer,
                feature_extractor=self.processor.feature_extractor,
                torch_dtype=self.torch_dtype,
                device=self.device,
                return_timestamps=True,
                generate_kwargs={"max_new_tokens": 400},
                chunk_length_s=5,
                stride_length_s=(1, 1),
            )
        except Exception as e:
            raise

    def transcribe(self, audio_path: str) -> tuple:
        try:
            # Perform transcription with timestamps
            result = self.pipe(audio_path)
            transcription = result['text']
            timestamps = result['chunks']
            return transcription, timestamps
        except Exception as e:
            return None, None
{% endhighlight %}

This implementation allows for the automatic transcription of an audio file passed as a parameter. Whisper’s native support for timestamps facilitates the alignment of audio segments with other tools (which we will explore in the diarization section), making it particularly useful for applications requiring temporal tracking of dialogues.

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Diarization">

## 2. Diarization: Identifying Speakers

**Diarization** is the technology used to segment an audio recording to identify different speakers. In other words, it structures conversations and answers the question: **"Who is speaking and when?"**.

Speaker identification is particularly useful in various contexts such as professional meetings, interviews, televised debates, or phone calls. It enhances the readability of transcriptions and facilitates the further analysis of audio data by associating each speech segment with its respective speaker.

### Diarization Techniques

Diarization involves several key steps:

1. **Segmentation**: The recording is divided into smaller segments based on pauses and speaker changes.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Segments are analyzed to extract unique vocal fingerprints based on acoustic parameters (tone, frequency, intensity).  
3. **Clustering**: Similar-sounding audio segments are grouped together to assign each segment to a unique speaker.  
4. **Identification**: In some applications, diarization can be combined with speech recognition to attribute a name or role to each speaker.  

Common approaches include neural network-based models, **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)**, and unsupervised clustering methods such as **Spectral Clustering**.  

### The Pyannote Model  

[Pyannote](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"} is an advanced diarization solution that leverages deep neural network models to identify speakers with high accuracy. Designed for seamless integration into audio processing pipelines, it can perform voice segmentation and identification in complex recordings, including those with background noise and overlapping speech.

#### Capabilities and Advantages of Pyannote:

- **High Accuracy**: Leveraging deep learning, Pyannote enhances speaker detection and differentiation, even in challenging acoustic environments.
- **Adaptability**: It can be used across various types of recordings, such as meetings, podcasts, or phone calls.
- **Modularity**: Pyannote integrates seamlessly with automatic transcription tools like Whisper, enabling enriched transcriptions that include speaker identification.
- **Compatibility**: It supports various audio formats and can be integrated into existing applications via APIs and Python scripts.

Combining Pyannote with Whisper allows for detailed transcriptions that specify not only the text but also the identity of the speakers.

### Implementing Pyannote in Python  

The implementation of **Pyannote** for diarization can be integrated into a Python program using the **pyannote.audio** library. This enables loading a pre-trained model and performing voice segmentation in just a few steps.

Here’s an approach based on the **Pyannote Speaker Diarization 3.1** model:

1. **Model Loading**: An instance of the `PyannoteDiarizer` class initializes and loads the diarization model from **Hugging Face**.  
2. **Diarization Execution**: The `diarize(audio_path)` method analyzes the audio file, identifying different speakers and segmenting their speech contributions.  

Here is a code snippet to implement this approach:  

{% highlight python %}
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
from pyannote.audio.pipelines.utils.hook import ProgressHook
import torch

class PyannoteDiarizer:
    def __init__(self, hf_token: str):
        try:
            self.pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained(
                "pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1",
                use_auth_token=hf_token
            )
            self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu")
            self.pipeline.to(self.device)
        except Exception as e:
            self.pipeline = None

    def diarize(self, audio_path: str):
        if self.pipeline is None:
            return None

        try:
            with ProgressHook() as hook:
                diarization = self.pipeline(audio_path, hook=hook)
                return diarization
        except Exception as e:
            return None
{% endhighlight %}

This implementation provides precise segmentation of speakers in an audio recording, making it easier to align Whisper-generated transcriptions with the corresponding segments.

<hr class="hr-text" data-content="Alignment">

## 3. Aligning Transcriptions with Audio Segments

Aligning transcriptions with audio segments involves matching each transcribed word or phrase to the correct speaker. In a conversation, overlaps, interruptions, or monologues complicate this task, requiring precise synchronization between transcription data and speaker identification.

For example, Whisper generates a transcription with timestamps:
- (from 0s to 3s) **Hello, how are you?**
- (from 3s to 5s) **Hello, I'm fine, thank you.**

Meanwhile, Pyannote identifies speakers and segments the audio as follows:
- **SPEAKER_00**: (from 0s to 3s)
- **SPEAKER_01**: (from 3s to 5s)

The challenge of alignment is to merge these pieces of information to associate each transcribed sentence with the correct speaker, ensuring an accurate representation of the conversation.

This step is essential for several reasons:  

- **Enhanced comprehension**: A properly aligned transcription clearly identifies who is speaking and when, making the text more understandable, especially in multi-speaker conversations.
- **Synchronized subtitle generation**: In videos and podcasts, precise alignment is crucial for creating coherent subtitles, improving accessibility and user experience.
- **Easier indexing and searching**: Well-segmented text allows targeted searches for a specific speaker or a particular part of a conversation, which is useful for media analysis and journalism.
- **Conversational analysis and interaction tracking**: Alignment helps better understand the dynamics of a discussion by identifying speech turns, interruptions, and exchanges between participants.
- **Optimized automated meeting summaries**: In professional settings such as meetings or conferences, accurately linking transcriptions to audio segments facilitates the generation of structured and useful reports.

As you can see, aligning transcriptions with audio segments goes beyond simple time matching—it plays a crucial role in the effective utilization and enhancement of audio data.

### Alignment Algorithms

Although it may seem simple, aligning transcriptions with audio segments is often complex and relies on merging data from automatic speech recognition (**Whisper**) and speaker diarization (**Pyannote**). The goal is to assign each transcribed text segment to the corresponding speaker while maintaining accurate timestamps.

#### Alignment Methodology Used

Alignment in this context is based on a **temporal intersection** approach between the segments provided by Whisper and those detected by Pyannote. The algorithm follows several steps:  

1. **Extracting Transcription and Diarization Segments**
   - Whisper generates a transcription divided into segments with associated timestamps.
   - Pyannote segments the audio, assigning a speaker identifier to each time interval.

2. **Matching Transcription Segments to Speakers**
   - For each segment produced by Whisper, the **best corresponding segment** is identified from Pyannote's output.
   - This match is based on **the greatest temporal overlap** between the transcribed segment and the detected speaker segments.

3. **Handling Special Cases**
   - If a transcription segment extends beyond the ranges defined by diarization, the algorithm adjusts the alignment by considering the end of the last detected segment.
   - If multiple speakers overlap, the algorithm selects the one with **the longest intersection duration** with the transcription segment.

4. **Merging Consecutive Segments from the Same Speaker**  
   - Consecutive segments belonging to the same speaker are **merged** to avoid excessive text fragmentation.  

#### Implementation in Python  

Here is an example of the full alignment process implementation:
- The `align()` method associates each transcribed text segment with diarization data and returns a list where each element contains: **the speaker, start and end timestamps, and the corresponding text**.
- The `find_best_match()` method searches for the diarization segment with the greatest temporal overlap with a given transcription segment.
- The `merge_consecutive_segments()` method merges adjacent segments belonging to the same speaker to improve the coherence of the aligned transcription.

{% highlight python %}
class SpeakerAligner():
    def align(self, transcription, timestamps, diarization):
        speaker_transcriptions = []

        # Find the end time of the last segment in diarization
        last_diarization_end = self.get_last_segment(diarization).end

        for chunk in timestamps:
            chunk_start = chunk['timestamp'][0]
            chunk_end = chunk['timestamp'][1]
            segment_text = chunk['text']

            # Handle the case where chunk_end is None
            if chunk_end is None:
                # Use the end of the last diarization segment as the default end time
                chunk_end = last_diarization_end if last_diarization_end is not None else chunk_start

            # Find the best matching speaker segment
            best_match = self.find_best_match(diarization, chunk_start, chunk_end)
            if best_match:
                speaker = best_match[2]  # Extract the speaker label
                speaker_transcriptions.append((speaker, chunk_start, chunk_end, segment_text))

        return speaker_transcriptions

    def find_best_match(self, diarization, start_time, end_time):
        best_match = None
        max_intersection = 0

        for turn, _, speaker in diarization.itertracks(yield_label=True):
            turn_start = turn.start
            turn_end = turn.end

            # Calculate intersection manually
            intersection_start = max(start_time, turn_start)
            intersection_end = min(end_time, turn_end)

            if intersection_start < intersection_end:
                intersection_length = intersection_end - intersection_start
                if intersection_length > max_intersection:
                    max_intersection = intersection_length
                    best_match = (turn_start, turn_end, speaker)

        return best_match

                    # Merge segments of the same speaker that are consecutive
                    previous_segment = (
                        previous_segment[0],
                        previous_segment[1],
                        segment[2],
                        previous_segment[3] + segment[3]
                    )
