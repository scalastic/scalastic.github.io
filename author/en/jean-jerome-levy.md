## Why Trust Me

As a freelance DevOps professional, I offer my expertise in the ever-evolving field of DevOps. Providing my skills to 
companies seeking a smooth and successful transformation, I am determined to bring substantial added value to your 
DevOps journey.

My trust as a DevOps guide is based on a diverse professional trajectory, during which my unique experience can be a 
valuable asset to your DevOps project:

- ### Beginnings as a Java Expert

My role as a Java consultant was marked by my ability to integrate R&D teams and contribute to the development and 
evolution of in-house frameworks. This experience greatly enriched my understanding of Service-Oriented Architectures 
(SOA), which, as a precursor, laid the foundation for the microservices architectures prevalent in today's Cloud. It 
also strengthened my technical skills to design robust and high-quality solutions.

Today, my interest lies in cutting-edge areas such as GraalVM and native Java code compilation. This orientation is 
particularly relevant in the context of the Cloud, where efficiency and performance are crucial.

- ### First Encounter with DevOps

As a Technical Architect, I led the implementation of a Software Forge and Automated Builds platform, based on Hudson, 
the precursor to Jenkins. This initiative enhanced my expertise, demonstrating my commitment to DevOps practices since 
its inception and my mastery of associated tools.

- ### Soaring with Software Infrastructure and Open Source

During my tenure as an Open Source technical expert, I left my mark by designing innovative solutions. The installation 
of key technical components was at the heart of my achievements, with in-depth expertise in technologies such as Linux, 
Nginx, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Symfony, Redis, MongoDB, as well as monitoring tools like Logstash and Elasticsearch.

I successfully led the steering of the infrastructure, orchestrating the implementation of an in-house CMS based on 
open-source technologies. This initiative involved designing a robust architecture, installing essential components, and
meticulous configuration to ensure high availability performance and optimal security.

This experience shaped my understanding of the nuances of software architecture in an open-source environment, enhancing
my ability to create sustainable and high-performance solutions. These skills continue to infuse my practice as a DevOps
professional, where mastery of technical components is crucial for project success.
