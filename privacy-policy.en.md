## Privacy Policy

The privacy of my visitors is extremely important to me. This privacy policy describes the personal information received and collected and how it is used.

First of all, I will never share your personal information with anyone without your express consent.

If you want to disable cookies, you can do so:
- Thanks to the options of your web browser. Instructions for this are available on the websites specific to your web browser.
- Or by refusing the use of cookies when accessing this site.

For complete information on cookies, I recommend you to visit the website of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union: <https://gdpr.eu/cookies/>.

## Service Disqus

When you visit this site, the external service [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) is used to manage comments on the web pages of this site. Although it is a very convenient service, it uses cookies stored on your computer. The main purpose of these cookies is to help you log in faster the next time you leave a comment. However they may allow Disqus to track your activity on other sites that would use this same service.
